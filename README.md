# Ross P. Coron - Personal Website

This is my personal website, designed and implemented as part of [CS50W's Project 0](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2019/x/projects/0/project0.html) in July 2019.

The website contains my CV, a list of my publications, and programming experience. The website is written in HTML with CSS / SCSS styling. A small amount of JavaScript is used to generate a pop-up when a button is activated (Programming page).
